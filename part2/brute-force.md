# Brute Force

> A brute force attack can manifest itself in many different ways, but
> primarily consists in an attacker configuring predetermined values,
> making requests to a server using those values, and then analyzing the
> response. For the sake of efficiency, an attacker may use a dictionary
> attack (with or without mutations) or a traditional brute-force attack
> (with given classes of characters e.g.: alphanumerical, special, case
> (in)sensitive). Considering a given method, number of tries,
> efficiency of the system which conducts the attack, and estimated
> efficiency of the system which is attacked the attacker is able to
> calculate approximately how long it will take to submit all chosen
> predetermined values.[^1]
