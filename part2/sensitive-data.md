# Sensitive data exposure

> Many website registrations use security questions for both password
> retrieval/reset and sign-in verification. Some also ask the same
> security questions when users call on the phone. Security questions
> are one method to verify the user and stop unauthorized access. But
> there are problems with security questions. Websites may use poor
> security questions that may have negative results:
>
> The user can’t accurately remember the answer or the answer changed,
> The question doesn’t work for the user, The question is not safe and
> could be discovered or guessed by others. It is essential that we use
> good questions. Good security questions meet five criteria. The answer
> to a good security question is:
>
> * **Safe**: cannot be guessed or researched
> * **Stable**: does not change over time
> * **Memorable**: can remember
> * **Simple**: is precise, easy, consistent
> * **Many**: has many possible answers
>
> It is difficult to find questions that meet all five criteria which
> means that some questions are good, some fair, and most are poor. **In
> reality, there are few if any GOOD security questions.** People share
> so much personal information on social media, blogs, and websites,
> that it is hard to find questions that meet the criteria above. In
> addition, many questions are not applicable to some people; for
> example, what is your oldest child’s nickname – but you don’t have a
> child.[^1]
