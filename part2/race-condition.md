# Race Condition

> A race condition or race hazard is the behavior of an electronics,
> software, or other system where the output is dependent on the
> sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes a bug
> when events do not happen in the order the programmer intended.[^1]

<!-- -->

> Many software race conditions have associated computer security
> implications. A race condition allows an attacker with access to a
> shared resource to cause other actors that utilize that resource to
> malfunction, resulting in effects including denial of service and
> privilege escalation.
>
> A specific kind of race condition involves checking for a predicate
> (e.g. for authentication), then acting on the predicate, while the
> state can change between the time of check and the time of use. When
> this kind of bug exists in security-sensitive code, a security
> vulnerability called a time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) bug is
> created.[^2]
