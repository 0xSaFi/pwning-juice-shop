### Access the administration section of the store {#adminSectionChallenge}

Just like the score board, the admin section was not part of your "happy path" tour because there seems to be no link to that section either.

#### Hints

* Knowing it exists, you can simply _guess_ what URL the admin section might have.
* Alternatively, you can try to find a reference or clue within the parts of the application that are _not usually visible_ in the browser
* It is just slightly harder to find than the score board link

### Get rid of all 5-star customer feedback {#fiveStarFeedbackChallenge}

If you successfully solved above [admin section challenge](#adminSectionChallenge) deleting the 5-star feedback is very easy.

#### Hints

* Check the Javascript console for errors if nothing happens when you try to delete feedback entries

### Change the href of the link within the O-Saft product description

#### Hints
