# Hosting a CTF event

> In computer security, Capture the Flag (CTF) is a computer security
> competition. CTF contests are usually designed to serve as an
> educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a
> machine, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks
> found in the real world. Reverse-engineering, network sniffing,
> protocol analysis, system administration, programming, and
> cryptanalysis are all skills which have been required by prior CTF
> contests at DEF CON. There are two main styles of capture the flag
> competitions: attack/defense and jeopardy.
>
> In an attack/defense style competition, each team is given a machine
> (or a small network) to defend on an isolated network. Teams are
> scored on both their success in defending their assigned machine and
> on their success in attacking the other team's machines. Depending on
> the nature of the particular CTF game, teams may either be attempting
> to take an opponent's flag from their machine or teams may be
> attempting to plant their own flag on their opponent's machine. Two of
> the more prominent attack/defense CTF's are held every year at DEF
> CON, the largest hacker conference, and the NYU-CSAW (Cyber Security
> Awareness Week), the largest student cyber-security contest.
>
> Jeopardy-style competitions usually involve multiple categories of
> problems, each of which contains a variety of questions of different
> point values and difficulties. Teams attempt to earn the most points
> in the competition's time frame (for example 24 hours), but do not
> directly attack each other. Rather than a race, this style of game
> play encourages taking time to approach challenges and prioritizes
> quantity of correct submissions over the timing.[^1]

### CTFd

Juice Shop comes with
[the convenient `juice-shop-ctf-cli` tool](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf)
to to simplify the hosting of CTFs using the open source

### Other frameworks

## Use in commercial CTFs

:warning: Bear in mind: With the increasing number of challenge solutions (this
book included) available on the Internet _it might **not** be wise to
host a professional CTF for prize money_ with OWASP Juice Shop!
