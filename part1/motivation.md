# Why OWASP Juice Shop exists

## Why the name "Juice Shop"?

In German there is a dedicated word for "dump", i.e. a store that sells lousy wares and does not value customer satisfaction much: "Saftladen". Reverse-translating this separately as "Saft" and "Laden" yields "juice" and "shop" in English. That is where the project name comes from. The fact that the initials "JS" match with those commonly used for "Javascript" was purely coincidental.

## Why yet another vulnerable web application?

There was a considerable number of vulnerable web applications out there before the Juice Shop was created. The [OWASP Vulnerable Web Applications Directory (VWAD)]() maintains a list of these, divided by online and offline usage as well as programming language used. When Juice Shop came to live there were only _server-side rendered_ applications in the VWAD. But _Rich Internet Application (RIA)_- or _Single Page Application (SPA)_-style applications were already a commodity at that time.
