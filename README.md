# Pwning OWASP Juice Shop

Written by [Bj√∂rn Kimminich](http://kimminich.de)

This is the official companion guide to the OWASP Juice Shop application.

The book should not be considered a comprehensive introduction to Web Application Security in general. For every category of vulnerabilities
present in the OWASP Juice Shop, you will instead find references to detailed attack descriptions and also possible mitigations.

The book is divided into three parts.

### Part I - Hacking preparations

Part one helps you to get the application running and to set up optional hacking tools.

### Part II - Challenge hunting

Part two gives an overview of the vulnerabilities found in the OWASP Juice Shop including hints how to find and exploit them in the application.

### Part III - Getting involved

Part three shows up various ways to contribute to the OWASP Juice Shop open source project.
