This is the official companion guide to the __OWASP Juice Shop__ application. Being a web application with well over 30 intended security vulnerabilities, the OWASP Juice Shop is supposed to be the opposite of a _best practice_ or _template application_ for web developers: It is an awareness, training, demonstration and exercise tool for security risks in modern web applications. The OWASP Juice Shop is an open-source project hosted by the non-profit [Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org) and is developed and maintained by volunteers.

The book is divided into three parts.

### Part I - Hacking preparations

Part one helps you to get the application running and to set up optional hacking tools.

### Part II - Challenge hunting

Part two gives an overview of the vulnerabilities found in the OWASP Juice Shop including hints how to find and exploit them in the application.

### Part III - Getting involved

Part three shows up various ways to contribute to the OWASP Juice Shop open source project.

_Please be aware that this book is not supposed to be a comprehensive introduction to Web Application Security in general. For every category of vulnerabilities
present in the OWASP Juice Shop you will find a brief explanation - typically by quoting existing sources on the topic. You will also find references to detailed attack descriptions as well as possible mitigations._
